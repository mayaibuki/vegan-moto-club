# Vegan Moto Club Website Rebuild Plan

## Understanding Your Goal

You want to:

1. **Keep** your product data in Notion (so you can edit it easily in one place)
2. **Replace** the Super.so/Notion website with a custom website you control
3. **Build** a site that shows your Notion products beautifully on a real website

## How This Works (Simple Explanation)

Think of it like this:

- **Notion** = Your database/spreadsheet (where you manage products)
- **Custom Website** = The storefront display (what visitors see)
- **Connection** = An automated bridge that pulls data from Notion → displays on website

When you update a product's price in Notion, your website automatically shows the new price. No manual updating needed.

## The Technical Setup (Don't worry, we'll handle it!)

### Phase 1: Extract Your Notion Data

- Create a special "API key" in Notion (a private password that lets code read your database)
- Test that we can read your products programmatically
- Map your Notion fields to website data

### Phase 2: Build the Website

We'll create a website using:

- **React/Next.js** - A JavaScript framework (modern, easy to work with)
- **Styling** - CSS/Tailwind for beautiful design (you control the look)
- **Hosting** - Deploy to Vercel (free, fast, reliable)

### Phase 3: Connect Notion to Website

- Add code that automatically fetches your products from Notion
- Display them beautifully with filters, search, sorting
- Cache the data so the site loads fast

## What You'll Be Able to Do

1. Edit products in Notion (add, remove, change prices, descriptions)
2. Changes appear on your website within seconds
3. Design the look however you want (filters, layout, colors)
4. Add new features without touching Notion

## Your Notion Databases (3 separate)

### Database 1: Products

Your Notion database tracks these fields for each vegan motorcycle gear product:

**Pinned/Core Fields** (used for filtering):

- Brand
- Category (Jackets, Gloves, Pants, Boots, Racing suit, Protection, Casual clothing)
- Level of Protection (Not protective → Most protective)
- Gender (Women, Men, Unisex)

**Product Details** (additional info):

- Photos (images)
- Price (USD)
- Description (detailed, AI-generated)
- URL (link to product)
- Riding Style (Dirt, ADV/touring, Commuting/street, Sport/canyon, Trackday/racing)
- Season (Summer, Mid-season, Winter)
- Waterproof Level (Not waterproof, Water resistant, Waterproof with specific technologies)
- Materials (25+ options from 3M Thinsulate to YKK zippers)
- Vegan Verified (Verified by us, Verified by maker, Waiting for confirmation)
- Staff Favorite (checkbox)
- Metadata (Created time, Created by, Last Updated, Last edited by)

### Database 2: Events

- Name of event
- Date range (from date → to date)
- Description
- Location
- URL (link to registration/more info)
- Price (or free)

### Database 3: Blog Posts

- Title
- Content/Body (the full blog post text)
- Publish Date
- Featured Image

---

## Your Design Choices

✅ **Browsing Layout**: Grid view with filters on the sidebar
✅ **Product Card Display**: Name, Brand, Price, Level of Protection, Season, Gender, URL
✅ **Sidebar Filters**: Brand, Category, Riding Style, Gender
✅ **Additional Pages**: Events and Blog content (also to be stored in Notion for easy management)
✅ **Overall Structure**: Full rebuild of current site + new product database integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Notion API Setup (Client responsibility with our guidance)

1. We'll give you step-by-step instructions to:
   - Enable Notion API in your workspace
   - Create an API integration token
   - Grant database access to the integration
   - Share the API key securely

### Phase 2: Build the Website (We'll handle this)

1. **Create a modern web framework** using Next.js + React + shadcn/ui
   - Fast, SEO-friendly, easy to deploy
   - shadcn/ui for pre-built, customizable components

2. **Build the product listing page** with:
   - Dynamic grid layout that pulls from Notion
   - Sidebar with filters (Brand, Category, Riding Style, Gender)
   - Search functionality
   - Product cards showing: Name, Brand, Price, Level of Protection, Season, Gender, URL

3. **Build supporting pages**:
   - Product detail page (full specs, materials, all info)
   - Events page (Notion-connected)
   - Blog page (Notion-connected)
   - About page

4. **Design system**:
   - shadcn/ui components as foundation (buttons, cards, dropdowns, filters, inputs)
   - Tailwind CSS for easy customization (colors, fonts, spacing)
   - You customize branding (we handle code adjustments)
   - Responsive design (works on phones, tablets, desktop)
   - Light/dark theme toggle (like your current site)

### Phase 3: Notion Integration (We'll handle this)

1. **Connect to your database**:
   - Use Notion API to fetch products automatically
   - Cache data for fast page loads
   - Set up automatic updates (refreshes when you edit Notion)

2. **Map Notion fields** to website display

3. **Test filtering and search** with real data

### Phase 4: Deploy (We'll handle this)

1. Deploy to Vercel (free, secure, fast)
2. Connect your domain (veganmotoclub.com)
3. Set up automatic updates when you deploy changes

## The Workflow (After Launch)

Every change you make in Notion happens automatically:

1. Update a product price in Notion
2. Website refreshes within seconds
3. Visitors see the new price

You never touch code—just manage your Notion database.

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (React 18)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui (buttons, cards, filters, dialogs, inputs, etc.)
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context API (simple, lightweight)
- **Data Fetching**: Notion API + React Query (for caching/auto-updates)

```

### How Data Flows

1. **You edit Notion** → Product data updated
2. **Website fetches from Notion** → Using Notion API key
3. **Data is cached** → Fast page loads
4. **Visitors see products** → Grid with filters, search
5. **User filters/searches** → Frontend filters data instantly
6. **Product detail page** → Shows all information from Notion

### The Customization Process

Once the site is built, you customize it like this:

1. **Change colors** → Edit `tailwind.config.ts` file
2. **Change fonts** → Edit `tailwind.config.ts` file
3. **Adjust spacing/sizing** → Edit `tailwind.config.ts` file
4. **Add your logo** → Replace image file
5. **Change text/copy** → Edit component files (I'll show you where)

Everything uses Tailwind CSS classes, so changes are simple and fast.

## Phase 5: Git Configuration & Deployment Issue

### Issue: Git Identity Not Configured

**Error:** `fatal: unable to auto-detect email address` and `error: src refspec main does not match any`

**Root Cause:**

Git doesn't know who you are (email and name not configured)

### Solution (3 Steps):

#### Step 1: Configure Your Git Identity

```bash
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replace:
- `your-email@example.com` with your actual email (can be any email, doesn't have to be GitHub email)
- `Your Name` with your name (e.g., "Maya Ibuki")

**Example:**

```bash
git config --global user.email "maya@veganmotoclub.com"
git config --global user.name "Maya Ibuki"
```

#### Step 2: Verify Git Identity

```bash
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```

Should show the email and name you just set.

#### Step 3: Retry the Git Push

```bash
cd /Users/mayaibuki/Documents/Claude/vegan-moto-club
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Vegan Moto Club website"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Success Indicator:

You should see output like:
```
Enumerating objects: ...
Counting objects: ...
Writing objects: ...
Total ... (delta ...), reused ... (delta ...)
To https://github.com/mayaibuki/vegan-moto-club.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main

### Session: February 3, 2026

#### Issue 1: Exposed Secrets in GitHub (Public Repository)
**Problem:** Notion API token and database IDs were exposed in documentation files.
**Solution:**
- Replaced secrets with placeholders in `PLAN.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- User regenerated Notion API token (old token invalidated)
- Commit: `540bd0f`

#### Issue 2: Wrong Environment Variable Values in Vercel
**Problem:** User had set all 4 environment variables to the same API token value.
**Solution:** Clarified the correct values:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NOTION_API_KEY` = Notion API token (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`)
- `NOTION_PRODUCTS_DB_ID` = `e6d109a83834445b8ca042e430c511f8`
- `NOTION_EVENTS_DB_ID` = `5e38c618f2ac4823a3ca0cafe9635693` (was using page ID, not database ID)
- `NOTION_BLOG_DB_ID` = `22d439de397b80039676fd22f633a2cf`

#### Issue 3: Property Name Mismatches in `lib/notion.ts`
**Problem:** Code property names didn't match actual Notion database schema.
**Solution:** Updated `lib/notion.ts`:

| Database | Code Expected | Notion Has | Fixed To |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Products | `Name` | `Name of product` | `Name of product` |
| Events | `Name` | `Name of event` | `Name of event` |
| Blog | `Title` | `Name` | `Name` |
| Blog | `Content/Body` | `Description` | `Description` |
| Blog | `Featured Image` | `Thumbnail Image` | `Thumbnail Image` |

- Added `Date` field support for blog sorting
- Commit: `aca5565`, `556f73e`

#### Issue 4: Next.js 14 Server/Client Component Error
**Problem:** Build failed with error: `Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props`
**Root Cause:** `onError` handlers on `<Image>` components can't be used in Server Components.
**Solution:** Removed `onError` handlers from:
- `components/ProductCard.tsx`
- `app/blog/page.tsx`
- `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/[id]/page.tsx`
- Commit: `d7ec540`

### Verification:
Build logs confirmed Notion connection is working - product names like "Mag-1", "Divide", "Bomber", "Horizon", "TFX4 WP", "RS3 EVO" appeared during prerendering.
